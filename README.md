# Customer-Acquisition_

## To analyze the customer acquisition process and identify insights for improving user growth in the EdTech company, we will focus on the following metrics and frame appropriate questions for analysis:

### Lead's Journey and Stages:
a. What is the distribution of leads across different stages of the customer acquisition flow (Lead, Awareness, Consideration, Conversion)?
b. How much time does it take for a lead to move from one stage to another?
c. Are there any bottlenecks or drop-offs at specific stages? If yes, what are the reasons for these drop-offs?
d. What is the conversion rate at each stage?

### Team Performance:
a. How many leads are assigned to each junior sales manager?
b. Which junior sales managers have the highest number of successful calls with leads?
c. Are there any patterns in the success rate of calls based on the stage of the lead?
d. Which senior sales managers have the highest conversion rates?

### Target Areas for Improvement:
a. What are the most common reasons for leads not attending demos or not being interested in the product at each stage?
b. Are there any patterns in the reasons for lack of interest in watching demos, consideration, or conversion?
c. Are there any demographic or lead characteristics that are correlated with higher conversion rates?

To perform the analysis, we will use the provided dataset and create visualizations using a visualization tool such as Google Data Studio,Tableau, MS Excel etc.
We will exclude any outliers from the dataset and focus on meaningful insights.
The final outcome will be a comprehensive dashboard presenting the insights and recommendations to help the business team design strategies for user growth.
